# Please answer the following questions

1.  In Jest, what are the differences between `describe()` and `it()` globals, and what are good uses for them?

  `describe()` is for grouping related tests into one test suite. `it()` is an alias of test, which is the
    function that holds and executes the test.


2.  What is the point of `Test Driven Development`? What do you think about this approach?
TDD will help the developer test their code as they write it and implement new features into what they are creating. A way to write it is to write a test that will fail all cases, then implement the code as you go so that it will pass. .

3.  What are `mocks`? What are a good use cases for them?
 `mocks` make it easy to link between code by erasing the actual implementation of a function and allowing test-timing configuration to return values.

4.  Mention three types of automated tests.

Functional Testing, Data driven testing, and unit testing.
